## Overview
Struggling to grasp the concept of 2's complement? This program is here to help you!

## How to run
`java TwoComplement`
## Helpful Notes
1. One's Complement simply flips all the bits to represent negative numbers.

2. Two's Complement is the same as One's Complement, but adds 1 to the flipped bits.

3. The most significant bit (left-most) is the sign bit.

4. If the sign bit is 0, the number is positive.

5. If the sign bit is 1, the number is negative.

6. With Two's Complement, we can simply add two positive and negative binaries together to get the correct sum.

7. To find the value of Two's Complement, we calculate the value of the left-most digit and treat it as a negative number. The rest of the digits are treated as positive.
