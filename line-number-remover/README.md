## Overview
This program removes line numbers from `Numbers.txt`. Simply paste the content of a file with the line numbers that you wish to rid it of into `Numbers.txt` and let the program do the magic!

## How to run
Run the program by using the command `java LineNumberRemover`. The program will prompt for the delimiter of the number (i.e. the symbol right after the number). For example, if each line of the file looks like this, 
```
1. statement  
2. statement
```
then the delimiter is a dot (`.`). The program will overwrite `Numbers.txt` after purging the line numbers. 

### Examples
Sample files with line numbers can be found in the `Example` subdirectory.
